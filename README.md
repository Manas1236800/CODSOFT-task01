## Projects

### Movie Genre Classification

In this project, I'm diving into the world of natural language processing to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. Leveraging techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings, I'll experiment with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. The goal is to unravel patterns in textual information and enhance my understanding of text-based classification challenges.
